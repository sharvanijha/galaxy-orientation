# galaxy orientation
Goal of project: to calculate the dark matter content of a galaxy as accurately as possible. I will start with what I did at COSMOS (summer 2016) and then continue to improve the program's accuracy to the best of my ability, step-by-step.

Below are assumptions made by the original project (as many as I can currently identify). If any have been attempted to be fixed, I will note my progress somewhere below (formatting to be determined). 
1. We counted the number of pixels correctly. (Human error.)
2. Our method of finding redshift is accurate. (Have to look more into this.)
3. The rotational velocity equation we used applies to all the galaxies we analyzed. (Probably not true.)
4. The website we used to calculate angular distance was accurate. (Have to look more into this.)
5. The galaxy is circular and thus has a uniform radius. (Most likely not true - will look into calculations for ellipses / spirals.)
6. The dynamical mass minus the visible mass will ONLY leave the dark matter content value. (Have to look into this - seems too clean to me as of right now.)
6. The inclination angle is 90 degrees (in other words, the galaxy is edge-on and its spirals are moving directly towards and away from us at no angle). (Probably not true, will look into how to get this information.)
7. Slit was perfectly aligned - no part of the galaxy was cut off. (Not sure if there's a way for me to check this unless perhaps the galaxy has been viewed on separate occassions? Will have to look into this.)
